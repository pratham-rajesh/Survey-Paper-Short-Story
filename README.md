## 🎯 Why I Chose This Paper

- **Direct fit for Data Mining:** The paper critically analyzes **dimensionality reduction (DR)**—a core data mining tool—across **biology, chemistry, physics, and business**, focusing on *how* DR is used rather than only describing algorithms.  
- **Survey style + scale:** Combines a **large bibliometric analysis (21,249 publications)** with a **close survey (71 papers)**, giving both breadth and depth for analysis.  
- **Practice-oriented insights:** Reveals **common workflows**, **interpretation patterns**, and **frequent misuses**, such as over-interpreting 2D embeddings—ideal for an applied article and presentation.  
- **Recency & credibility:** A **2025 arXiv preprint**, accepted to **IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)** and IEEE VIS, ensuring strong scholarly quality.

> **In short:** This paper bridges the gap between *data mining theory* and *practical application*, showing how dimensionality reduction is used (and misused) in real-world scientific workflows.
